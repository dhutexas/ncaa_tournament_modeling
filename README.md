NCAA College Basketball Tournament Modeling
-----------------------

Each year the college basketball season comes to an end in a dramatic fashion -- the NCAA Tournament. With 68 teams battling for the title of champion, and millions of people filling out brackets to predict the winners, the topic is exciting to sports fans, statisticians, and statistician sports fans. This repository houses several projects I've worked on over the past years, each related to either directly predicting the probability of each team winning a matchup in the tournament or seeking insight into these predictions.
